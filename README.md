# Pagination Directive

Yes, there are quite a few pagination solutions for Angular out there already, but what I wanted to do was make
something that would be truly plug-n-play - no need to do any set-up or logic in your controller. Just add
an attribute, drop in your navigation wherever you like, and boom - instant, full-featured pagination.
